## Charge-based memory element

Here is example of charge-based memory element.

The main principle is:

There is two states - 1 and 0.

Round is the place where we get most of N charges in our N-stripe.

there is 3 inputs - Write, Value, Read.

Setting Write to 1 enables write.

Setting Write to 0 disables write.

Stored value readed from Value.

Stored result readed from Read.

That is bistable element.

Write signal simply enables move of charge in the storage stripe.

Stored value can be readed from Read stripe.

There can be any form of storage stripe.

That is quite useful (if you know quantum physics - get your 2M years of discharge).
If you have lithography down to atoms - get your Pb(ps).
Works perfectly with charge-based logical elements. 

Can works even with transistors (TTL).
(In-memory computing)

You can change charge density with light :).

Or even turn off and turn on leds (to make [Shadow zone](https://github.com/ValeriyAndreevichPushkarev/ShadowZone)).

Everyone heard about that (50 shades of gray, Lightsaber and so on).
 
Its like Covid vaccine, my dear Fags (https://youtu.be/g8OcwZo_6G4?t=190) - FUNNY AS FUCK! (or convulsions from lack of oxygen, im think its They/Them should decide(!)) xDDD
 
## Charge-based memory element

And here is more "obvious" version of that element.

Of cause, you can simply remove "Write enable" to get bistable element.
