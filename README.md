## Charge-based memory element

Here is example of charge-based memory element.

The main principle is:

There is two states - 1 and 0.

Round is the place where we get most of N charges in our N-stripe.

there is 3 inputs - Write, Value, Read.

Setting Write to 1 enables write.

Setting Write to 0 disables write.

Stored value readed from Value.

Stored result readed from Read.

That is bistable element.

Write signal simply enables move of charge in the storage stripe.

Stored value can be readed from Read stripe.

There can be any form of storage stripe.

That is quite useful (if you know quantum physics - get your 2M years of discharge).
If you have lithography down to atoms - get your Pb(ps).
Works perfectly with charge-based logical elements. 

Can works even with transistors (TTL).
